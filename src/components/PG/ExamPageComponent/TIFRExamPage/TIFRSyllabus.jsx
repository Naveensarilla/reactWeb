            <p><b>PHYSICAL SCIENCES</b></p>
            <li>In general, the syllabus for the Admissions Tests in Physics (Written and Interview) is typically a course of studies in Physics as the main subject in the Undergraduate and Masters levels in an Indian University. The questions in the written test (multiple- choice type) and the interviews are distributed over the following areas: Classical Mechanics; Mathematics relevant to Physics; Electricity and Magnetism; Quantum Mechanics; Heat, Thermodynamics and Statistical Physics; General Physics; Modern Physics; Electronics and Experimental Physics.</li><br />

            <p><b>CHEMICAL SCIENCES</b></p>
            <li>The syllabus for the Written test in Chemistry is similar to the typical standard syllabus followed in any Indian university for the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degree course. The questions are aimed at testing the basic understanding and knowledge in the areas of physical, organic, inorganic, analytical, electro and quantum chemistry, biophysics, thermodynamics, spectroscopy (NMR, fluorescence, IR, UV and X-ray), logic and statistics and mathematical methods.</li><br />
